What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily used for client-side scripting
on the web. JavaScript is often used to add interactive elements to websites, create web applications, and develop desktop and mobile applications.
JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development. 


 What is the difference between b/w let and var?
 Var can be declared and accessed globally. Let can be declared globally, but its access is limited to the block in which it is declared. Variables declared using var can be re-declared and updated within the same scope. Variables declared with let can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.

 Why do we prefer const over var?
 Const is preferred over var because it provides a way to declare a constant, which means the value of
 the variable cannot be changed once it is declared. This helps in preventing accidental changes to the variable and
 makes the code more predictable and maintainable.


What is the use of javascript in web browsers? 
JavaScript is used in web browsers to add interactivity to websites. It allows developers to create dynamic web
pages that respond to user interactions, such as clicking buttons, hovering over elements, and submitting forms.


What are Objects?
Objects are collections of key-value pairs. They are used to store and manipulate data in a structured way
Objects are created using the {} syntax, and properties are added to the object using the dot notation or
bracket notation.


What is an array and how is it different from an Object in Javascript? 
An array is a collection of values of the same type stored in a single variable. In JavaScript,
arrays are denoted by square brackets [] and elements are separated by commas. 
Arrays are different from objects in that they are ordered collections of values, whereas objects are unordered
collections of key-value pairs.

What is a function? 
A function is a block of code that can be executed multiple times from different parts of a program.
Functions are used to perform specific tasks, and they can take arguments and return values. In JavaScript,
functions are declared using the function keyword, and they can be called by using the function name followed by
parentheses containing the arguments.


How can we implement call by value and call by reference in Javascript?  
Call by value: In JavaScript, when a function is called, the arguments are passed by value,
meaning that a copy of the original value is passed to the function. This means that any changes made
to the argument within the function do not affect the original value.
Call by reference: JavaScript does not support call by reference in the classical sense. However, we can
achieve similar behavior by passing an object as an argument to a function. Since objects are passed by
reference, any changes made to the object within the function affect the original object.

What are the primitive data types in Javascript?
The primitive data types in JavaScript are:
1. Number: represents a numeric value
2. String: represents a sequence of characters
3. Boolean: represents a true or false value
4. Null: represents the intentional absence of any object value
5. Undefined: represents an uninitialized variable or a non-existent property
6. Symbol: represents a unique identifier (introduced in ECMAScript 2015)


 What is DOM?
 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the
 structure of a document as a tree of nodes, allowing developers to dynamically access and manipulate the
 content and structure of a document. In JavaScript, the DOM is used to interact with web pages and
 respond to user interactions.

 Why do we need DOM?
 We need DOM because it allows JavaScript to access and manipulate the content of a web page. Without
 DOM, JavaScript would not be able to interact with the web page, and web pages would be static
 and unresponsive to user interactions.
